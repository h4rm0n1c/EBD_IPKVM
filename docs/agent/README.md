# Agent docs

This folder exists so automated assistants (and humans) don’t lose context.

## What goes here
- `decisions.md`: durable design choices (pin maps, protocol, timing, architecture)
- `log.md`: running changelog (date + summary + why)
- `notes.md`: quirks, gotchas, measurements, scope screenshots references, etc.

Rule of thumb: if it would save you 30 minutes next week, write it down now.
