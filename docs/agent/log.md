# Log (running)

- 2026-02-05: Implemented the core1 ADB bus state machine with Talk/Listen parsing, register storage for keyboard/mouse, SRQ gating, and CDC2 queue draining into register 0 payloads.
- 2026-02-05: Added CDC2 ASCII-to-ADB keycode mapping and aligned ADB event decoding to the adb_queue union layout.
- 2026-02-05: Gate ADB RX sampling on a rising edge and keep the RX state machine disabled while the bus is held low to avoid false RX activity.
- 2026-02-05: Note the observed Mac power-up ADB line behavior (~3.979 ms low pulse after rising high, first Talk traffic ~1 ms later).
- 2026-02-05: Only latch ADB RX activity when a command/listen payload completes to avoid RX-seen spam from idle noise.
- 2026-02-05: Replace the ADB PIO programs with hootswitch’s device-side bus PIO implementation and add its GPLv3 license under licenses/.
- 2026-02-05: Shift SRQ pulse timing to the hootswitch device-side PIO flow instead of software-timed pulses.
- 2026-02-05: Align attention handling to hootswitch’s GPIO rising-edge flow (IRQ-driven) to decide reset vs command.
- 2026-02-05: Align command/SRQ handling to hootswitch’s stop-bit + GPIO rise flow before executing Talk/Listen.
- 2026-02-05: Track SRQ pending state with a hootswitch-style SRQ bitfield to simplify SRQ gating decisions.
- 2026-02-05: Align ADB GPIO rising-edge handling to hootswitch’s setup flow so short attention/stop-bit rises execute immediately instead of waiting on an IRQ.
- 2026-02-05: Match hootswitch SRQ gating so non-target Talk $0 commands still emit SRQ when any device has pending data.

- 2026-02-05: Buffer mouse reports into a per-device reg0 queue so Talk 0 drain matches hootswitch queue semantics.

- 2026-02-05: Allow reg0 pop callbacks to carry a queue context pointer for hootswitch-style driver-owned queues.
- 2026-02-06: Wired ADB driver callbacks (handler ID + reg0 pop) through a new adb_driver layer, and shifted keyboard/mouse queue handling into that driver so callbacks remain driver-owned across bus resets.
- 2026-02-06: Added hootswitch-style ADB debug counters (attention, short attention, reset, abort, error, abort timestamp) and surfaced them in the CDC debug output.
- 2026-02-06: Added hootswitch-style handler ID validation in adb_driver (keyboard allows 0x01-0x03; mouse allows 0x01/0x02/0x04) to mirror per-device handler policies.
