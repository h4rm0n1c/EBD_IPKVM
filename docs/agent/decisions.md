# Decisions (running)

- 2026-01-27: Byte-swap each 32-bit PIO RX FIFO word in firmware before USB enqueue so host unpacking receives correctly ordered pixels.
- 2026-01-27: Phase-lock PIXCLK after HSYNC and pre-roll the falling-edge capture so the first wait sees a real edge (prevents 1-pixel phase slips).
- 2026-01-27: For PIXCLK rising-edge capture, force PIXCLK low before the first `wait 1`; for falling-edge capture, wait high→low before sampling each bit to prevent phase-dependent jitter.
- 2026-01-27: End frames on VSYNC and use ping-pong framebuffers so capture timing stays locked while USB packetization runs in the main loop.
- 2026-01-27: Debounce VSYNC edges and only mark frames for transmit when the USB TX path is idle to prevent backpressure skips.
- 2026-01-27: Capture each frame with a single DMA transfer into a contiguous buffer and abort on VSYNC to avoid per-line DMA timing hazards.
- 2026-01-27: When a captured frame has fewer than `CAP_YOFF_LINES + CAP_ACTIVE_H` lines, derive the start line from the end of the capture so we still transmit a full active region.
- 2026-01-25: Repository initialised with docs-first workflow and agent documentation scaffold.
- 2026-01-26: Use GPIO9 (via ULN2803) as an active-high ATX PS_ON output; add CDC commands for PS_ON control, BOOTSEL, and watchdog reset.
- 2026-01-26: Use polling-based edge sampling for GPIO diagnostics to avoid interrupt overload on PIXCLK while still confirming activity.
- 2026-01-26: Add a force-capture command to bypass VSYNC gating for troubleshooting capture stalls.
- 2026-01-26: Add a synthetic test-frame command to validate USB streaming when capture remains stalled.
- 2026-01-26: Skip force-capture fallback when explicitly running synthetic test frames.
- 2026-01-26: Add a probe packet command to verify CDC byte delivery independently of framing.
- 2026-01-26: Emit a probe packet alongside synthetic test frames for immediate CDC verification.
- 2026-01-26: Add an on-demand debug command to expose CDC/queue state without a scope.
- 2026-01-25: Switch line-capture trigger to HSYNC falling edge to validate sync polarity.
- 2026-01-25: Set horizontal skip to 178 PIXCLK cycles after HSYNC falling edge based on VCD sweep results.
- 2026-01-25: Add runtime CDC toggles for HSYNC/VSYNC edge selection to speed capture validation.
- 2026-01-25: Add runtime CDC toggle for PIXCLK edge selection to diagnose sampling phase.
