# ADB wiring + control notes

## GPIO assignment

| Signal | GPIO | Direction | Level shifting | Notes |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | -------------- | ----- |
| ADB RECV | GPIO6 | Input | 74LVC245 | Receives ADB data from the Mac (non-inverting). |
| ADB XMIT | GPIO12 | Output | ULN2803 | Drives the shared ADB data line (open-collector, inverted: GPIO high pulls bus low). |

## Electrical constraints
- The ADB data line is shared between RECV and XMIT; ensure open-collector behavior on the transmit path.
- GPIO12 is inverted on the transmit driver: driving the GPIO high pulls the ADB bus low, so PIO should invert its output polarity accordingly.
- Do not connect 5V ADB signals directly to RP2040 GPIO; use level shifting (74LVC245) and an open-collector driver (ULN2803).
- Ground is common between the Mac ADB port and the RP2040.

## Implementation notes
- ADB should follow the same core split as the video pipeline (AppleCore): PIO for timing and core1 for RX/TX state handling, with core0 only enqueueing host commands.
- Core1 maintains a simple ADB device model (keyboard + mouse) with four registers, Talk/Listen parsing, and SRQ gating.
- ADB timing on PIO uses the hootswitch device-side bus implementation (GPLv3), with the license captured under `licenses/hootswitch-GPLv3.txt`.

## Register model (current firmware)

### Common
- Registers are stored as up to 8 bytes each.
- Talk responses are produced when a register has a non-zero length; Talk with an empty register yields no response.
- SRQ is raised when register 0 has pending input data and SRQ is enabled in register 3.

### Keyboard (default address 2)
- **Register 0**: two keycodes per report. If only one key is queued, the second byte is `0xFF`.
  - Key releases are encoded with bit 7 set (`code | 0x80`).
- **Register 2**: reserved for modifiers/LED state (host Listen updates stored verbatim).
- **Register 3 (Talk)**: `0b01SRRRRR` (bit 5 = SRQ enable, bit 6 = exceptional event, bits 0-3 = randomized nibble), followed by handler ID. The randomized nibble mirrors hootswitch’s reg3 behavior for address-resolution flows. If the handler ID is `0xFF`, no reg3 response is produced (hootswitch parity).

#### CDC2 ASCII → ADB keycodes (current mapping)
- The CDC2 test channel maps printable ASCII to the US ADB keycode set.
- Uppercase letters map to their lowercase keycode without modifiers.
- Enter/Return maps to ADB `0x24`, Tab to `0x30`, Space to `0x31`, Escape to `0x35`, and Backspace/Delete (`0x08`/`0x7F`) to `0x33`.

### Mouse (default address 3)
- **Register 0**: two bytes.
  - Byte 0: bit 7 = button 0 state (1 = pressed), bits 0-6 = X delta (signed 7-bit).
  - Byte 1: Y delta (signed 8-bit).
- **Register 3 (Talk)**: same format as keyboard (randomized nibble + SRQ enable + handler ID).

### Listen register 3 behavior
- `low == 0x00`: set address to `up[3:0]`, update SRQ enable from `up[5]`.
- `low == 0xFE`: set address to `up[3:0]`, preserve SRQ enable.
- `low == 0xFD` or `0xFF`: ignored.
- other values: treated as handler ID proposal (stored).

## Validation checklist (next steps)
Use this to confirm the ported hootswitch device-side behavior on real hardware.
Consult the ADB Manager PDF under `/opt/adb/miscdocs/ADB_Manager.pdf` for exact
timing windows and the AN591B reference for signal diagrams.

### 1) Hardware sanity checks
- Confirm the ADB line idles high with the Mac powered on and that the level
  shifters are in place (74LVC245 on GPIO6, ULN2803 on GPIO12).
- Verify GPIO12 inversion: the bus should pull low when GPIO12 is driven high.
- Use a scope/logic analyzer on the ADB line and compare waveforms to the ADB
  spec (attention, sync, data bit cells, stop bit, and the SRQ pulse width).

### 2) Host-facing ADB traffic validation
- Open CDC1 and verify the firmware is alive and reporting status:
  - `scripts/open_debug_console.sh`
- Open CDC2 and inject test inputs:
  - `picocom -b 115200 /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Raspberry_Pi_EBD_IPKVM_*-if04`
  - Type ASCII to generate key events, use arrow keys for mouse moves, and
    `Ctrl+R` to toggle the primary mouse button.
- On the Mac, confirm keyboard input and mouse motion are recognized. If SRQ
  is working, the Mac should poll and receive input promptly after events.

### 3) Listen/Flush behavior
- Change keyboard or mouse settings on the Mac (e.g., Key Repeat/Mouse speed)
  and verify the device continues to respond; these changes trigger Listen
  writes from the host.
- Trigger an ADB bus reset (power cycle the Mac or reset ADB) and confirm the
  device returns to default address/handler IDs and clears queued input.

### 4) Timing-focused validation
- Measure the SRQ pulse width generated by the device-side PIO on stop-bit.
- Validate bit-cell timing (attention, sync, data, stop) against the ADB
  Manager spec; adjust PIO dividers only if measurements are out of spec.
